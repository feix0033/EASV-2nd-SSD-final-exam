# Documentation

This directory contains all project documentation for the SSD exam project.

## Directory Structure

### `/screenshots`
Contains screenshots of security scan results:
- SNYK vulnerability findings
- CodeQL code scanning alerts
- Trivy container scan results
- GitHub Security dashboard
- CI/CD pipeline execution

### `/architecture`
Contains architecture diagrams and visual representations:
- Security pipeline architecture
- Data flow diagrams
- Tool integration diagrams
- CRA compliance mappings

### `/reports`
Contains generated security reports:
- SNYK JSON reports
- Trivy scan results
- CodeQL SARIF files
- Test coverage reports

## How to Use

1. **Taking Screenshots**: After running the security pipeline, capture screenshots of:
   - GitHub Actions workflow runs
   - Security tab findings
   - Individual tool results
   - Vulnerability details

2. **Creating Diagrams**: Use tools like:
   - Draw.io (https://app.diagrams.net/)
   - Excalidraw (https://excalidraw.com/)
   - Mermaid diagrams in Markdown

3. **Saving Reports**: Security reports are automatically generated by the CI/CD pipeline and can be:
   - Downloaded from GitHub Actions artifacts
   - Accessed via the Security tab
   - Copied to this directory for synopsis

## Synopsis Preparation

All materials in this directory should be referenced in your final synopsis:
- Include screenshots as evidence
- Reference architecture diagrams to explain implementation
- Cite security reports to demonstrate findings
- Use these materials in your presentation
